# Archibus Quest

You are the Director of a Section of the **Department of Procurement and Efficiency (DoPE)**.
Your Department has recently switched to a hotelling model, so your employees have to hunt for a free cubicle each morning. Will you be able to sit your employees close to each other, so that they can better collaborate and have interesting watercooler chats? Watch out! Other Directors are planning to do the same, but the space is limited...

## Introduction

Archibus Quest is an area control game for 2 to 6 players, I guess. The goal of the game is to place meeples of your color onto desk tiles on the game board and build the largest block of adjacent meeples of your color.

## Game contents

The following contents are free to print:

- A game board, 7x7 desk tiles
- 80 Playing Cards
- 4 Scoring Cards
- 3 Faulty Equipment tokens
- 3 Bedbug tokens

This content cannot be downloaded, you must procure it yourself:

- 1 six-sided die
- 2 to 6 sets of 15 coloured meeples or similar game tokens (you can also use beans, coins, bottle caps, etc.)

## Game setup

1. Place the board on a table, with enough chairs for all the players around the table.
2. Shuffle the deck of Playing Cards.
3. For each player, draw 3 Playing Cards from the deck and place them face down. In this way, create as many 3-card decks as there are players.
4. Line the players against a wall, 4-5 metres away from the table. If the room where you are in is too small, line up the players against a wall in _another room_.
5. When you give the GO! all players run towards the game table, grab a chair and one of the 3-cards decks. Quick players are allowed to snoop at multiple decks before choosing one.
6. Now, take the remaining deck and split it into 4 roughly equal decks. Place one of the 4 Scoring Cards at the bottom of each deck and stack all the decks back.
7. The player who most recently requested an official document (e.g. passport, birth certificate, criminal check record) starts the game, and the game proceeds clockwise.

## Scoring

> _Adjacent meeples_: two meeples are considered adjacent if they are placed on two desk tiles that share one border. Two meeples are not considered adjactent if the two desk tiles they are placed on share no border or share only a corner.

## Game end

The game ends when the fourth and final Scoring Card appears. Points are scored one last time, and the player who scored the most point is declared the winner. In case of a tie, the player who can shout the loudest is declared the winner.
